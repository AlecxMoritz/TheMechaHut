We appologize to our pilots, mechanics, and everyone envolved with our BattleBots program, and our loyal fans. The stadium housing the BattleBots tournaments was destroyed during our Spring Invitational, and the damage is extensive. We are happy to report that the stadium was evacuated and no one was seriously hurt, and the pilots were able to leave the stadium in their suits to protect themselves from injury. We have contactors and builders working to get us back up and running, but it is a massive project. We thank you for your patience and cannot wait to see what you'll bring back for us next year!<br>-BattleBots Team</div>

            <p class="card-text">This is our favorite model. The RX-78-2, sometimes called The White Suite, has been popular for years, and now, we bring it to you at a steal of a price. This model is extremely lightweight due to being made from Luna Titanium Alloy, and having a hollow torso. This will let you dock an FF-X7 Core Fighter with your White Suite! This model comes with many features, including but not limited to: Heatproof Field, Magnetic Coating, a Learning Computer, the Core Block System, and various hardpoints for attaching weapons, shields, or more ammuniton. The White Suite comes with some of our most advanced weaponry as well, it comes stock with: Vulcan guns, Beam Sabers, a Beam Cannon and Javeline, Hyper Hammer, Beam Rifle, Hyper Bazookas, and a shield. The RX-78-2 is a fully loaded, whallop of a suite, and do not recomend it for first time buyers as it may be too much to handle. Experienced pilots take note, this ones just for you! (FF X-7 Core Fighter sold separately)</p>

            <p class="card-text">One of our favorite models that comes from our friends overseas is our RX-0 Unicorn. This model was created to be the be-all and end-all of mobile suits. It comes loaded with a multitude of beam powered weapons, Hyper Bazooka, and a <i>Destory Mode</i> which features even more weapons systems, and will allow the suit to glow in all of it various hard points. The Unicorn is for experienced pilots only, we recomend about five years of expierence before you set foot in the Unicorn. This model features the NT-D system, which activates the <i>Destroy Mode</i> and scans the pilots brainwaves continuously, allowing the Unicorn to be pilots completely by thought. The <i>Destory Mode</i> can only be held for five minutes however, before the limiter is engaged and begins administering drugs to help slow the pilots bloodflow back down and the NT-D system shuts down. For our master class pilots, this one's for you!</p>
